The Attribute Protocol

The Attribute Protocol (ATT) is used to expose the attributes of a device through Bluetooth. The
protocol does this though a client-server relationship between two devices. The server contains
the attributes that can be read or modified by the client.

Unsurprisingly, this library has implementations of an Attribute `Server` and `Client`.
